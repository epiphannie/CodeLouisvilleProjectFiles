PEP - Python Enhancement Proposal

PEP 8: How python code should look

top level functions should have two blank lines between them
tab = 4 spaces

blank line between the methods in in a class
no blank line between the class declaration and the first method

two blank lines between classes and other items

spaces after every comma and around operators that are not inside of a function call

no space between function name and parentheses, no space inside either

two spaces before an inline comment

imports are the top line of the file
libraries should each be imported in their own line

several arguments should all be on the same line

function names and variable names are all lower case with underscores

classes should start with an uppercase letter

flake8 can be used to review spacing/naming


PEP 20: The Zen of Python -- import this in a repl

PEP 257: Docstring is at the beginning of a class/method/function that explains what it's for

"""content of the docstring"""
help(file.functionname)

Docstrings that can fit on one line, should. Docstrings that can't, have their final triple quotes on their own line

Logging:
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='file name', level = logging.DEBUG)
there are six log levels. The level listed in the function is the lowest level that will trigger a log.

logging.info(), logging.debug() the type of message triggers a warning of that level


Python Debugger (PDB):
import pdb
pdb.set_trace() <<--starts the debugger at a given point
next <<--will advance to the next line of the code. Can also use 'n'
'q' to quit pdb
